# [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) Examples

This [repo](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI_examples) contains examples of what is achievable with [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI). All the images in this repo contain metadata which means they can be loaded into ComfyUI with the Load button (or dragged onto the window) to get the full workflow that was used to create the image.

A good place to start if you have no idea how any of this works is the:
